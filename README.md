## My process

I write the basic structure of the web using HTML and then styled it using CSS. This challenge is supposed to be the "easiest" one on the page but since i don't have any experience, i had a few confusion while working on it. Especially when I try to positioning the container in the viewport. Also I'm still not used to make any design to be responsive.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to use flex box on multiple occasions. Responsive design is one of my weakness so through this challenge i tried my best to implement it. 

I tried my best to use rems and vh instead of px (rem still confuses me every time).

I also had a hard time using flex box. Sometimes I'm still confused between justify-content and justify-items. 
I was trying to put the element in the center horizontally and vertically. I successfully center it horizontally, but for some reason, it sticks on top of the document. Then after some googling anf trial and error, i ended up wrapping the container in another container, set the height to 100 vh, then set the display to flex. After that I can finally center it not only horizontally but also vertically.

Another thing that I'm still not comfortable yet is adding box shadow to a container. 

### Continued development

After this challenge, I will focus my learning on responsive design and flex box (also CSS grid). I really want to be comfortable using them for future design. I'm sure it will be so much fun to code after I fully understand all of that.

### Useful resources

- [Flex Box Container](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox_container.asp) - This helped me to fix my container positioning  using flex box.
- [Box Shadow](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_shadows_box.asp) - This helped me to understand how to add a box shadow.
